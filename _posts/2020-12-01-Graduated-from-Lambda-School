## I have learned so much this year!

I am very excited to share that I have completed the Data Science and Machine Learning Program at Lambda School! I feel very fortunate to have had this experience and all while under quarantine. I'm also incredibly thankful for the supportive community within Lambda that has helped me to grow. I spent my first few months learning about Data Science and predictive modeling. The quality of instruction was impressive and I found myself wishing there were more hours in the day because we were absorbing so much information. I also really looked up to the Team Leads who were there to interact with us one-on-one and help us find answers to our questions. I decided that I really wanted to learn the content more deeply by helping other students as well. Lambda hired me as a Team Lead over the summer and it has been a very rewarding experience. I've met a lot of great, talented people along the way.

I went to Lambda to learn more technical skills and break into Natural Language Processing. I saw that the Data Science curriculum included statistics, Python, and predictive modeling and I decided that I this program was a good fit. Lambda does a great job encouraging you to pursue your interests and use your domain knowledge. They did a great job instilling a sense of self-reliance. I came out with a confidence in myself that I did not have last year. I know that if I want to learn something outside of my regular studies that I can find the resources and learn it on my own. This is one of the most important skills that I have come out with and it will help me to continue to learn and grow as a Data Scientist.
